## Intro: 
* This repo has an R markdown file, the resulting html and the r code that goes into various tidyverse capabilities. Specifically, the repo goes through learning the various tidyverse "verbs" such as filter, summarize, arrange, group_by, etc. There's also a fair amount of plotting, using the ggplot functionality.

## Technologies used:

* RStudio, tidyverse library, gapminder data (from within tidyverse) and ggplot (also from within tidyverse).


## Project status: 
* Completed as of 22 August 2020 in prep for 2nd semester of UVA's MSDS Data Science curriculum, specifically SYS 6018, which intends to use tidyverse extensively.

## Sources.
* The main data came from gapminder, embedded in the tidyverse library. See the html below for more on gapminder, they have the best bubble plots!!
